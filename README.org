* Weak Collections for PHP

** class WeakArray

Implements an array of where the values are always a weak reference in the
array.  In other words, this is an array you can stick things in without forcing
those objects to stay alive.  If the object becomes invalid, so too does the
key.

Useful for things like keeping a cache of database objects, so if two things ask
for the same ID, you can give them the same underlying object without causing
the object to stay in memory unnecessarily.

Contrast this with WeakMap, which attaches arbitrary data to a weakly-referenced
key.

** Bonus

The optional-weakref branch provides compatibility shims for WeakRef and
WeakMap, so you can develop against the weakref PECL extension without
installing it everywhere (with the hopefully-obvious caveat that without the
weakref extension, all references are strong).
